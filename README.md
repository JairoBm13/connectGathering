# Common Ground - Find Local Community, Make Friends

## Project Description

**Common Ground** is a web application to help users to find local community through automatically matching users in communities based on their interests and location.

_This project was completed during the [South Florida Hackathon 2025 "Hack for South Florida"](https://tickets.joinshowup.io/event/hackathon-2025-hack-for-south-florid)._

## Motivation / Problem

In this day in age it is difficult to find people in your community that share the same interest and values. Making friends is hard, and it's only becoming more difficult with time.

There are currently several websites/apps on the market which intend to resolve this issue:
* WhatsApp
* Meetup
* Discord
* Facebook Groups
* Eventbrite

Yet these apps each have a bottleneck which our solution, **Common Ground**, intends to resolve.
