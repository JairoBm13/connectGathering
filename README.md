# Common Ground - Find Local Community, Make Friends

## Project Description

**Common Ground** is a web application to help users to find local community through automatically matching users within communities based on their interests and location.

_This project was completed during the [South Florida Hackathon 2025 "Hack for South Florida"](https://tickets.joinshowup.io/event/hackathon-2025-hack-for-south-florid)._

## Motivation / Problem

In this day in age it is difficult to find people in your community that share the same interest and values. Making friends is hard, and it's only becoming more difficult with time.

There are currently several websites/apps on the market which intend to resolve this issue:
* WhatsApp
* Meetup
* Discord
* Facebook Groups
* Eventbrite

Yet these apps each have their own bottleneck which our solution, **Common Ground**, intends to resolve.

## Proposed Solution

Our solution consists of having the application put users into communities based on their interests they selected and their geographic location. The app puts the people together!

## Key Characteristics
* Web application
* Database of users, events, and groups
* Automatic group creation based on interests

* The backend:
  * Go
  * MongoDB
* The frontend:

# Future Work / Next Steps

* Matchmaking users based on factors like gender, age, etc. in addition to the apps current ability to match on interests.

* create more social features like chat, message board, etc.
* Verification of users, events, locations.
