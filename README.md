# Common Ground - Find Local Community, Make Friends

## Project Description

**Common Ground** is a web app that helps people discover local communities by automatically connecting users with others who share their interests and live in their local area.

_This project was completed during the [South Florida Hackathon 2025 "Hack for South Florida"](https://tickets.joinshowup.io/event/hackathon-2025-hack-for-south-florid)._

## Motivation / Problem

In this day and age, building meaningful local connections is harder than ever. While existing apps (Meetup, Facebook Groups, Discord, etc.) provide ways to organize events, they each have bottlenecks that hinder the user experience in making connections. 

## Proposed Solution

Common Ground automatically creates communities based on usersâ€™ selected interests and geographic proximity. Instead of forcing people to search endlessly for groups, our app builds tailored spaces where friendships and collaboration can thrive.

* Web application
