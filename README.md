# Common Ground - Find Local Community, Make Friends

## Project Description

**Common Ground** is a web app that helps people discover local communities by automatically connecting users with others who share their interests and live nearby.

_This project was completed during the [South Florida Hackathon 2025 "Hack for South Florida"](https://tickets.joinshowup.io/event/hackathon-2025-hack-for-south-florid)._

## Motivation / Problem

In this day and age it is difficult to find people in your community that share the same interest and values. Making friends is hard, and it's only becoming more difficult with time.

There are currently several websites/apps on the market which intend to resolve this issue:
* WhatsApp
* Meetup
* Discord
* Facebook Groups
* Eventbrite

Yet these apps each have their own bottleneck which our solution, **Common Ground**, intends to resolve.

## Proposed Solution

Common Ground automatically creates communities based on usersâ€™ selected interests and geographic proximity. Instead of forcing people to search endlessly for groups, our app builds tailored spaces where friendships and collaboration can thrive.

## Key Characteristics
* User-friendly registration
* Web application
* Database of users, events, and groups
* Automatic group creation based on interests

## Used Technologies
* The backend:
  * Go -> Straightforward, quick to implement API
  * MongoDB -> Very responsive, good for prototyping (not tied to a relational dataset).
  * These were chosen as the team was faimilar with these tools and they were conducive to the problem were solving.
* The frontend:
  * JavaScript ->
  * React ->
  * Vite ->
* Design:
  * Figma -> Give us a template that started in that language in the front end, which is why we continued to use it in the front end.
* AI:
  * Copilot ->
  * ChatGPT ->

## Future Work / Next Steps

* Matchmaking users based on factors like gender, age, etc. in addition to the apps current ability to match on interests.
* Expanded event planning.
* Event notifications.
* Develop richer social features, such as chat and message boards.
* Verification of users, events, locations.
* Explore monetization strategies (e.g., ads, partnerships).
* Logo.
